    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the dough:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the filling:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps And Procedures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, cumin, and coriander for the dough. Gradually add the vegetable oil
            while mixing with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the warm water and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp
            cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the
            chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or lamb to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook for an additional 2-3
            minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the chopped cilantro. Let the filling cool completely.</li>
        <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into small balls, about the size of a golf ball.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin circle or oval shape.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the cooled filling onto one half of the dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the other half of the dough over the filling to create a triangular shape. Press the edges firmly to seal the
            Sambusa.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls and filling.</li>
        <li>In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat oil over medium heat. Fry the Sambusas in batches until they turn golden brown
            and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the Sambusas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the African Sambusas hot as a delightful appetizer or snack. They can be enjoyed on their own or paired with
            chutney or sauce of your choice.</li>
