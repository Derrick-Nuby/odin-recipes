    a favorite in your household.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or your favorite cheese)</li>
        <li>Burger toppings of your choice (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, etc.)</li>
        <li>Condiments of your choice (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps and procedures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop pan to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, gently combine the ground beef, salt, and black pepper. Be careful not to overmix, as this can
            result in a tougher burger. Form the mixture into four equal-sized patties, slightly larger than the size of your
            burger buns.</li>
        <li>Place the burger patties on the preheated grill or pan. Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until desired
            doneness is reached. For medium-rare, aim for an internal temperature of 135°F (57°C), medium at 145°F (63°C), and
            well-done at 160°F (71°C).</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking, add a slice of cheese on top of each patty to allow it to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Assemble your burger by placing a cooked patty with melted cheese on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato slices, onion, and pickles, on top of the patty.</li>
        <li>Drizzle or spread your favorite condiments, such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, or barbecue sauce, on the top half
            of the bun.</li>
        <li>Place the top half of the bun on your burger, gently pressing it down to hold everything together.</li>
        <li>Serve your delicious homemade burgers with a side of fries, coleslaw, or any other accompaniments of your choice.
        </li>
